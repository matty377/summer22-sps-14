# Translation

## Getting Started

This walkthrough introduces Cloud Translation, which lets you translate text
from one language to another.

You can return to this walkthrough anytime by running this command:

```bash

```

## The Goal

The goal of this project is to use Cloud Translation to add a translation
feature to your portfolio.

This walkthrough introduces a lot of concepts, but you don't have to use all of
them. Decide what makes sense for your goal.

Don't be afraid to get creative, but focus on creating a
[minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
that proves you have all of the pieces connected, and then come back later and
add extra features if you have time left over.

## Cloud Translation

[Cloud Translation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/) is a set of tools
designed for translating text. These are the tools that
[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) is built with, and the API
lets us programmatically translate text.

The Cloud Translation APIs use machine learning models that have already been
trained, so you can skip straight to the fun stuff. It's also possible to train
your own models (you can learn more about that
[here](https://cloud.google.com/automl/), but this guide is going to stick with
the pre-trained models.

## Enable Cloud Translation API

Before you can use the Cloud Translation API, you have to enable it. Go here:

<https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/translate.googleapis.com>

Make sure your project is selected, and click the `Enable` button.

## Minimal Google Translate

The `examples/minimal-google-translate` directory contains an example project
that translates a message posted by a user. The next few steps walk you through
this example project.

## Maven Dependency

As mentioned above, the Cloud Translation API lets you write code that
translates text. It's available as a web service, or as a library that can be
called from many languages. You're going to use it as a Java library.

To use the Cloud Translation library, first add the dependency to your
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/portfolio/pom.xml">
  pom.xml
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-cloud-translate</artifactId>
  <version>1.70.0</version>
</dependency>
```

You can read the documentation for the Java library
[here](https://googleapis.dev/java/google-cloud-clients/latest/com/google/cloud/translate/package-summary.html),
and the next few steps work through an example.

## TranslationServlet

Read through
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-3-libraries/translation/examples/minimal-google-translate/src/main/java/com/google/sps/servlets/TranslationServlet.java">
  TranslationServlet.java
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
and find this code:

```java
String originalText = request.getParameter("text");
String languageCode = request.getParameter("languageCode");

// Do the translation.
Translate translate = TranslateOptions.getDefaultInstance().getService();
Translation translation =
    translate.translate(originalText, Translate.TranslateOption.targetLanguage(languageCode));
String translatedText = translation.getTranslatedText();
```

This code gets the `originalText` and `languageCode` parameters from the
request, and uses Cloud Translate to translate the text.

## Language Codes

To use Cloud Translate, you need to pass it a language code.

These language codes come from [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639),
a standard for language names. A language code is a 2-letter abbreviation that
stands for a specific language. You can view a full list
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), but here are some
examples:

-   `zh`: Chinese
-   `en`: English
-   `hi`: Hindi
-   `es`: Spanish
-   `ar`: Arabic

## Your Turn

Your goal is to use the concepts you just learned about to add a translation
feature to your portfolio.

It's up to you exactly what that means. You could add something similar to the
minimal Google Translate example to your page. Or you could do something like
translate your "about me" section into different languages.

Try to break this goal down into smaller steps, and then take each step on
individually.

-   Add the Cloud Translate dependency to your
    <walkthrough-editor-open-file
        filePath="software-product-sprint/portfolio/pom.xml">
      pom.xml
    </walkthrough-editor-open-file> file.
-   Add some HTML or JavaScript to your portfolio page that requests
    translations from your server, either of hard-coded content (like your
    "about me" section) or of user-entered content.
-   Add a servlet that handles that request by translating the text and writing
    the result to the response.
-   Modify your HTML and JavaScript to add the response to the page.

Again, it's up to you exactly what you do with your translation feature. If
you're stuck, talk to your team and your advisor to help you brainstorm ideas!

## Pull Requests

Your advisor will be reviewing your code to provide feedback and support.
Create a pull request from your code so your advisor can review it.

You don't have to wait until you're finished to send your code for review. In
fact, it's better if you send multiple small pull requests instead of one big
one!

Make sure your code is reviewed and merged into your repo before the end of the
week.

## Live Server

When you're happy with your feature and you're ready to show it to the world,
deploy it to your live server!

Your
<walkthrough-editor-open-file
    filePath="software-product-sprint/portfolio/pom.xml">
  pom.xml
</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
file should already contain your project ID. If so, you can deploy to your live
server by executing this command:

```bash
mvn package appengine:deploy
```

After the command successfully completes, you can navigate to
`YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com` to see your portfolio and test your feature.

When you're done, share this link in the chat and with your team!

## Congratulations

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

Congratulations! Your portfolio page now contains a working translation feature!

Make sure your code is reviewed and submitted to your repo before the end of the
week.
