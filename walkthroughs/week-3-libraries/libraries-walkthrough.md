# Libraries

## Getting Started

Over the past 2 weeks, you've learned about client-side HTML and JavaScript, and
server-side Java.

This week, you're going to learn about libraries that provide access to various
features of Google Cloud.

Your goal this week is to work through at least **one** of the library projects
to add another feature to your portfolio.

You can return to this walkthrough anytime by running this command:

```bash
teachme ~/software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-3-libraries/libraries-walkthrough.md
```

## Choose a Library

Choose one of the following libraries to add to your portfolio:

### Datastore

Datastore permanently stores data you get from users.

Start the Datastore walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-3-libraries/datastore/datastore-walkthrough.md
```

### Cloud Storage

Cloud Storage lets users upload files like images.

Start the Cloud Storage walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-3-libraries/cloud-storage/cloud-storage-walkthrough.md
```

### Image Analysis

Image analysis detects the contents of an image.

Start the image analysis walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-3-libraries/image-analysis/image-analysis-walkthrough.md
```

**Note:** This project requires Cloud Storage, so if you're interested in image
analysis, make sure to finish the Cloud Storage project first!

### Charts

Google Charts embeds an interactive chart in your webpage.

Start the charts walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/software-product-sprint/walkthroughs/week-3-libraries/charts/charts-walkthrough.md
```

## Congratulations

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

Congratulations! Your portfolio should now contain a feature that uses a
library! Make sure your
[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) works and is
submitted to your GitHub repo by the end of the week.

If you have time left over, consider working through another project or adding
more functionality to what you've done so far!
